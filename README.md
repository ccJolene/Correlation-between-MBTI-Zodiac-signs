# Correlation-between-MBTI-Zodiac-signs

## Introduction

Hey there, awesome people! 👋

Have you ever wondered if your zodiac sign might have something to do with your MBTI type? For example, if you're a passionate Leo🦁️ or a shrewd Scorpio🦂️, does that influence your MBTI type? Well, that's exactly what we're about to explore.

We've got a super cool dataset filled with two things: MBTI types and zodiac sign. If you've ever encountered MBTI, you know it categorizes personality traits into four dimensions -— Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. These are the elements that shape our personalities.

With this data, we'll dive deep into the relationship between zodiac signs and MBTI, looking for interesting patterns or correlations. Are most INFJs born under a specific sign? Are summer babies more outgoing and passionate or emotionally intense? Or do certain types appear more often in different years?

But just a heads-up, we're here to enjoy the process, not to conduct serious scientific research. Remember, correlation doesn't equal causation. However, who doesn't love uncovering a fun mystery?

So, grab your detective hats and let's embark on this journey where astrology and MBTI types collide! 🎉🔥
