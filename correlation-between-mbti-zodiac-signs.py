# # Correlation between MBTI & Zodiac signs
# 
# **Author: Jolene (INTP)**
# 
# # Introduction
# Hey there, awesome people! üëã
# 
# Have you ever wondered if your zodiac sign might have something to do with your MBTI type? For example, if you're a passionate Leoü¶ÅÔ∏è or a shrewd Scorpioü¶ÇÔ∏è, does that influence your MBTI type? Well, that's exactly what we're about to explore.
# 
# We've got a super cool dataset filled with two things: MBTI types and zodiac sign. If you've ever encountered MBTI, you know it categorizes personality traits into four dimensions -‚Äî Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. These are the elements that shape our personalities.
# 
# With this data, we'll dive deep into the relationship between zodiac signs and MBTI, looking for interesting patterns or correlations. Are most INFJs born under a specific sign? Are summer babies more outgoing and passionate or emotionally intense? Or do certain types appear more often in different years?
# 
# But just a heads-up, we're here to enjoy the process, not to conduct serious scientific research. Remember, correlation doesn't equal causation. However, who doesn't love uncovering a fun mystery?
# 
# So, grab your detective hats and let's embark on this journey where astrology and MBTI types collide! üéâüî•

# ## MBTI type v.s Zodiac Sign
# 
# Now that we have a general overview of the data, we can jump into more fun stuff.
# 
# In this segment, we're going to dive into whether the zodiac sign has anything to do with your MBTI type. It's like astrology meets psychology, but with a data-driven spin. So, are Aries folks more likely to be ENFJs? When will we see a flood of INFPs? Let's crunch the numbers and find out!
# 
# ### Type Zodiac sign Distribution
# 
# Firstly, we can take a look at how each MBTI Type is distributed across the months of the year.

# %%
sns.boxplot(data = data, x = 'Zodiac category', y = 'MBTI Type')

# %% [markdown]
# Alright, let's deep dive into this boxplot we've got here. It's like a party where each MBTI type shows us when they typically land their birthday cake throughout the year. Keep in mind this is just a slice of the entire MBTI pie - it's the people who were groovy enough to fill out our form.
# 
# 1. First off, for more than half of the MBTI types, their birthdays are evenly spread throughout the year, just like sprinkles on a doughnut - they start slow in January and ramp up all the way to December.
# 
# 2. For our reliable ISTJs, introspective INFPs, ambitious INTJs, innovative ENTPs, and imaginative ENFPs, it looks like they couldn't wait to get into the world - the majority of them celebrated their first hello in the first half of the year (their median month is before June).
# 
# 3. On the other hand, our deep INFJs, logical INTPs, warm ESFJs, dutiful ISFJs, proactive ENFJs, and natural leaders ESTJs took their sweet time to arrive - a big chunk of these folks started their journey in the latter half of the year (their median month is after June).
# 
# *Now, we have some interesting exceptions who aren't so evenly distributed across the year:*
# 
# 1. **ISTPs**, our practical connoisseurs, mostly cluster in the warm months from May to August.
# 
# 2. **ENFJs**, our benevolent leaders, hit their peak in November, with a few rare occurrences in January. It's like they collectively decided that November is the best time to show up!
# 
# 3. **ENTJs** seem to enjoy the enthusiastic summer months - their median month is July, but they max out in October, covering the Cancer, Leo, and Virgo periods.
# 
# 4. **ESFPs**, the life of the party, start making an entrance in January and keep up the momentum until April. Maybe they enjoy the spring sunshine and ease?
# 
# 5. The serious and dedicated **ESTJs** have an interesting trend - their entire middle half (the IQR, if we're talking stats lingo) spans only from August to September, with no outliers.
# 
# 6. **ESTPs**, the doers, are slightly skewed towards the latter half of the year, with their median month in May and extending until December.
# 
# 7. Our ambitious **INTJs** have a curious pattern. Their main birthday cluster is between May and July - that's their entire IQR! This extends all the way to December.

# # Conclusion
# 
# There you have it, folks! We've taken a wild ride through the world of MBTI types and zodiac signs. We've seen how personality types are distributed across the months of the year, with certain types showing up more frequently in specific months. What's most intriguing is that no matter how we manipulate these variables, it doesn't seem to affect the lack of correlation between them. Could this mean that personality is minimally influenced by innate factors and more by external environments?
# 
# However, let's remember, this isn't an exact science. Our survey had a significant imbalance in categories, with a large number of INFPs and INTJs, which might have influenced the results. To truly understand the MBTI world, we need a broader mix of all personality types and more extensive data.
# 
# Nonetheless, we hope you've enjoyed this journey as much as we have. It's all about exploration and understanding, just like a good mixtape where each personality type adds its own unique flavor to the mix. Until next time, keep being yourself, because you make the world a more interesting place!
